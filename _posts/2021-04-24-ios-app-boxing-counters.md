Counter punching is a crucial technique to add to your arsenal as a boxer. Natural counter punchers step off, wait for gaps left by more offensive fighters and reel off combinations... so how to improve and get there?

In the recently released version 1.21.0 of the Shadow Boxing app for iOS, we've added the counter punching mode. It's very similar to the pad work one, but with a focus on reacting to attacks and starting with a defensive movement.

Of course if you want to customize the experience even more, you can use [the combo creator](/build-custom-combos-boxing-app/) to get the same result!
