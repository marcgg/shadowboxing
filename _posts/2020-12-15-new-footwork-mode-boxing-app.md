We recently released the 1.16 version of [Shadow Boxing App](/), our iOS mobile application for boxing training at home.

In the [previous release](/new-simple-combo-punching-bag/) we focused on hitting hard with various [punching bag](/punching-bag-app-boxing/) exercises. This time it's the opposite, everything is focused on movement, so tighten your shoes and get ready to alternate between 5 simple drills  that will improve your stability and speed.

This new exercise also gave  us the idea to mix [footwork](/footwork-boxing-app/), [dodges](/boxing-dodge-app/), jump rope, freestyle & squats  into a new training that will get your legs ready for a fight! With this new workout we are finally covering all the basics requirement for a complete boxing workout, so we're looking forward to see how people will use it.
