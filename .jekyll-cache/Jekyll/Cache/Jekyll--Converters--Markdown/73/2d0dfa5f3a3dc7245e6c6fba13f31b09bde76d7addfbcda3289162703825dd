I"Š<p>Most coders complain about wrist pain. For some reason I never had major trouble there except when working for hours on a laptop. My main issue seemed more original and was located in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thenar_eminence">the group of muscles controlling the thumb</a>. Suddently it would hurt for days, then go away, then come backâ€¦ good times.
